                            Welcome to our application, where we offer a unique service that tracks your screen time and provides an analysis of whether you may be at risk of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

                            We understand that in today's digital age, screens have become an integral part of our daily lives. While they provide us with convenience and entertainment, excessive screen time can lead to several negative effects, including a decrease in attention span and focus. These effects can be particularly problematic for individuals who are at risk of developing ADHD.
