                Determining whether someone has ADHD or not requires a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed healthcare provider. Screen time habits can provide an indication of whether someone may be at risk for developing ADHD, but they cannot diagnose the condition on their own.

                Our website provides an analysis of your screen time habits and how they may be impacting your overall well-being. However, we do not make any claims about whether you have ADHD or not. Our service is designed to offer insights and recommendations for reducing screen time and improving attention span, which can be helpful for individuals who may be at risk of developing ADHD or who are experiencing symptoms.
